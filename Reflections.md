## Reflections

### Naming

| Naming & explanation | Reflection & rules from Clean Code |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `StringCryption` This is the name of the main class in the library/module, the public interface. | **Class Names:** Class names should be nouns or noun phrases. <br> **Use Pronouncable names:** Even though i am now realizing that im breaking the rule of `Dont be cute`, this class name reads quite well. |
| `encryptAtChosenLevel` This is the name of the method that chooses encryption algorithm based on the user selected level (Second parameter, number between 1-5). |  **Method Names:** Method names should be verbs or verb phrases. <br> **Use Intention-Revealing Names:** The name clearly indicates that it encrypts at a chosen level.|
| `decryptAtChosenLevel` This is the name of the method that decrypts the encrypted string. | **Method Names:** Method names should be verbs or verb phrases. <br> **Use Intention-Revealing Names:** The name clearly indicates that it encrypts at a chosen level.|
| `levelOfEncryption` This is the second parameter of the encryption method and refers to the level of complexity the user should choose. | **Use Intention-Revealing Names:** The name clearly indicates that it represents the level of encryption. <br> **Avoid Disinformation:** The name is not misleading.|
| `input` This is the first parameter of the encryption method and refers to the actual string to be encrypted, it is used for the same purpose across the classes | **Use Intention-Revealing names:** The name quite clearly suggests that this is the input string to encrypt. <br> **Avoid Encodings:** Simple name, does not use prefixes or Hungarian notation.|

### Clean Code Chapter 2 Reflections
Most of the rules mentioned and explained in this chapter make a lot of sense and are in fact very obvious, yet hard to consider while the code is being written. After reading this chapter I can see flaws in my previous naming, I can see flaws in the naming in this project as well but with a major improvement. In this project my ability to follow the two rules of `Avoid disinformation` and `Make meaningful distinctions` have improved a lot just from reading the rules, my mindset changed from "Keep the naming as short as possible" to more of a "Name it after what it is, just keep it consistent and make sure you can speak the name.". Which brings me to the most important rule according to me, `use pronouncable names`, tightly followed by the two rules i mentioned earlier. If the naming is implemented in such a way that it is hard to speak, it can be causing disinformative confusion and the possible meaningful distinctions in there might be lost in the confusion. So, make sure you can utter the name of your methods and variables first, then make sure they are full of information.

| `encryptAtChosenLevel`<br> [Link to StringCryption.java @ GitHub](https://github.com/Letssdothiss/610-L2/blob/main/src/main/java/stringCryption/StringCryption.java) | 30 | **Rule Followed:** The method name is descriptive and intention-revealing. <br>  **Rule Followed:** Prefers exceptions to returning error codes. <br> **Rule Broken:** Extract try/catch blocks and The method is quite long and does multiple things (validation, encryption selection, error handling).<br> I dont know if it is considered as a rule break but it is not recommended to have more then one parameter and here there are two (dyadic). <br> **Suggestion:** Break down the method into smaller functions, each handling a specific task, the try catch block to should be moved to its own function according to the litterature.|

### Clean Code Chapter 3 Reflection
In regard to chapter 3 of the litterature i see a lot of room for improvement still, there are several functions that could be broken down to smaller functions. Though if i compare this project to earlier projects I can instantly see the major improvements in naming, size of functions, abstraction levels, the consideration taken before adding parameters to functions and more. Earlier projects could contain functions/methods with more then a hundred lines of code where as now the largest in this project is 30, and that is because of a switch statement which in itself generate several lines. So to summarize, it is almost overwhelming with the rules on funcitons/methods, it is challenging to try and implement it all at once. 

### Final Reflections
This project was my first try to adhere to a completely new set of rules on how to write code, it has required a complete shift in mindset and to ignore some of the previously learned standards. I was used to writing long methods that often had cryptic names and several parameters aswell as being intertvined with each other, breaking several, if not most of the rules provided in Clean Code. Now that I have been trying to implement the code while adhering to rules such as `Use intention revealing names`, `Use pronounceable names`, `Functions should do one thing` and more, refactoring large and complex methods in to smaller methods to avoid breaking the single responsibility principle. The readability of the code have drastically improved with refactoring and the understandability aswell with proper naming. This refactoring reasoning in conjunction with abstracting the low level code and high level code in to different classes has, according to me, improved my code quality quite a lot.
I agree with the part of prefering exceptions to returning error codes (or null values), that is how i have always prefered to do it and now i have reason and confirmation that it one proper way to do it. Exceptions always provide a clear indication to what went wrong and where. 
More on naming and avoiding disinformation, it has been a challenge in every single project so far to come up with good and short identifier names, but with this new reasoning i feel like this issue is gone. When you remove the unwritten rule of keeping the names short and instead add the rule of using intention revealing names it becomes quite an easy task to name the classes, variables, methods and functions etc.   
Another subject to touch on that has been affected is the commenting, it has been drastically reduced due to descriptive and proper naming, I no longer felt the need to add comments to all the methods i wrote since the naming was so clear and the size of the methods so much smaller that the increased readability was enough.
I could keep this reflection going, but to summarize, I have a long way to go with the quality of my own code. But the progress towards cleaner code made in this project alone is to me, very satisfying and exciting.
