# Test Application

This test application allows you to encrypt and decrypt strings using different levels of encryption complexity. The encryption levels range from 1 to 5, with 1 being the simplest and 5 being the most complex.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Compile and run the `TestApplication` class.

2. **Enter a String to Encrypt:**
   - When prompted, enter the string you want to encrypt.(avoid special characters such as åäöÅÄÖ etc.)

3. **Choose the Level of Encryption:**
   - Enter a number between 1 and 5 to choose the level of encryption complexity.

4. **View the Encrypted String:**
   - The application will display the original string, the chosen level of encryption, and the encrypted string.

5. **Decrypt the String:**
   - Press any key to decrypt the string. The application will display the decrypted string.

6. **Try Again:**
   - When prompted, enter `y` to try again or `n` to exit the application.

   ## Notes

- Ensure that you enter a valid encryption level (1-5). If an invalid level is entered, an error message will be displayed.
- The application will continue to run until you choose to exit by entering  when prompted to try again.
